```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(leaflet)
```


##  Required date is **`r date()`**

## And here is a fancy map
```{r map, echo = FALSE}
df <- data.frame(lat = runif(20, min = 42.08, max = 42.081), lon = runif(20, min = -88.071, max = -88.07))
map <- df %>% leaflet() %>% addTiles() %>% addMarkers(clusterOptions = markerClusterOptions()) %>% addCircleMarkers()
map
```
